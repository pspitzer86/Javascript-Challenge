# Javascript-UFO-Sightings

For this project, a javascript dataset of UFO sightings from January 1st, 2010 to January 13th, 2010 from various locations around the US and Canada was provided.  An HTML file with a certain setup was also provided along with a css style sheet.  The purpose of the project was to create a javascript file that would read the data from the javascript dataset and populate a table on the provided html based on input provided by the user.  For the first part of the project, a forEach was used to grab every value for each UFO sighting object and created a table from the data when the webpage is first opened.  A filter button and input form were already created for the page.  Using event code for the button and form, the input provided by the user would be read and then compared to all data in the table in order to query out all data mathcing the input.  For part one the only input is the datetime.  For part 2, more input forms needed to be added to allow the user to filter by several different columns simultaneously, these columns being datetime, city, state, cuntry, and shape.  The event for the forms were removed so only the button could be used to filter what the user inputed.  A for loop through a list of the columns was used to compare each of the user inputs with the data in the table to create a new table with all data that matched inputs for any and all of the five different acceptable inputs.
