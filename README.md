# Javascript-Challenge

For this assignment, we are given a javascript dataset of UFO sightings from January 1st, 2010 to January 13th, 2010 from various locations around the US and Canada.  An HTML file with a certain setup was provided along with a css style sheet.  The purpose of the assignment was to create a javascript file that would read the data from the data javascript file and populate a table on the provided html based on input provided by the user.  For the first part of the exercise, a forEach was used to grab every value for each UFO sighting object and create a table from the data when the webpage is first opened.  A filter button and input form were already created for the page.  Using event code for the button and form, the input provided by the user would be read and then compared to all data in the table in order to query out all dat mathcing the input.  For UFO-1 the only input is the datetime.  For UFO-2, more input forms needed to be added to allow the user to filter by several different columns simultaneously, these columns being datetime, city, state, cuntry, and shape.  The event for the forms were removed so only the button could be used to filter what the user inputed.  A for loop through a list of the columns was used to compare each of the user inputs with the data in the table to create a new table with all data that matched inputs for any and all of the five different acceptable inputs.
